# Playwright-Framework
Hey there! Welcome to my Playwright Framework, crafted with TypeScript! This framework is all about bringing together Playwright and Docker for testing that's smooth sailing in containerized environments. 

With Cucumber onboard, it's all about that BDD-style goodness, making test scenarios a breeze to write and understand, perfect for team collaboration. Plus, it's Jenkins-ready, so you can seamlessly slot it into your CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing bliss.
