# Welcome to my Playwright-Framework
üëã Hey there! Welcome to my Playwright Framework, crafted with TypeScript! This framework is all about bringing together Playwright and Docker for testing that's smooth sailing in containerized environments. 

With Cucumber ü•í onboard, it's all about that BDD-style goodness, making test scenarios a breeze to write and understand, perfect for team collaboration. Plus, it's Jenkins-ready, so you can seamlessly slot it into your CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing bliss. 

üîß Ready to dive into web automation with confidence and ease?

# Docker Prerequisites üê≥
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

You have Docker Desktop installed on your system. 
You have an understanding of how to use Docker containers.

# To run the docker compose file run:

``docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up``

## Manuall Container creating instruction
If you need to create a Docker Container manually, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt window.
Execute one of the following commands based on your **operating system:**

### For Windows CMD

Copy code:

``docker run -it --rm --name playwright-container -v "%cd%:/app" mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.42.1-jammy``

### For Linux or PowerShell

Copy code:

``docker run -it --rm --name playwright-container -v $PWD:/app mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.42.1-jammy``

Now you need to install OpenJDK 11 into your Docker container, open a **new CMD window** and run the following command:

Copy code:

``docker exec -it <your_container_id> bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk"``

Once the Docker container is running, execute the following commands inside the container:

Copy code:

```
cd /app
npm install
```
To execute the tests, run:

Copy code:

``npx playwright test``

If it's a Cucumber project, run:

Copy code:

``npm run test``

## Additional Instructions
To switch to the **root directory** of your container, run:

Copy code:

``docker exec -u root -it <your_container_id> bash``
